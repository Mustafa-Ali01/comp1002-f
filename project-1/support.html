                    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h3>
                    
                    <h4>Q: My dime was taken but the call didn't connect. What should I do?</h4>
                    <p>A: Our automatic coin return should handle this. If it failed, please call the repair number (below) and provide the booth's location identifier. We will mail a refund check immediately.</p>

                    <h4>Q: The interior light is out. Is the phone still operational?</h4>
                    <p>A: Yes, the light is a separate circuit. The telephone itself should still be fully functional. Please report the booth location so our repair crew can replace the bulb.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Q: Can I use this booth for long-distance calls?</h4>
                    <p>A: Absolutely! The Model 700 accepts all major calling cards for long-distance service, or you can call the operator for a collect call.</p>
